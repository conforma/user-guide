= Enterprise Contract Configuration

Enterprise Contract configuration is described xref:ecc:ROOT:index.adoc[here].

The configuration used by EC can be provided by an
xref:ecc:ROOT:reference.adoc[`EnterpriseContractPolicy` cluster resource], or
it can be fetched from a git url.

For xref:cli.adoc[command line use] of Enterprise Contract a local file can also be used.

There are some pre-defined configuration files available
link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config[here].

== Finding the configuration used

The output of the Enterprise Contract task includes a copy of the configuration
used. You can find it under the `policy` key in the raw YAML output where it
can be copy and pasted.

TIP: Notice that the public key used to verify both the signed images and the
signed attestations created by Tekton Chains is available in the YAML output
also. This public key is useful if you want to use Enterprise Contract outside the
Konflux cluster as described xref:cli.adoc[here].

== Modifying the Enterprise Contract configuration used in Konflux

To change which configuration is used by the Enterprise Contract integration
test, it is necessary to modify the applicable "IntegrationTestScenario"
cluster resouce.

This is currently not possible via the web UI, so it must be done using either
`kubectl` or `oc`.

See xref:custom-config.adoc[Using custom configuration] for details on how to do this.
