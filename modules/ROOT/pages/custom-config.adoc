= Using custom configuration

== Accessing the Konflux cluster using `oc` or `kubectl`

include::partial$oc_login.adoc[]

You can then view the integration test scenario CRs, for example:

[,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get integrationtestscenario
$ oc get integrationtestscenario __<testname>__ -o yaml
----

== Adding the policy configuration parameter

A convenient method of modifying a CR is to use the `oc edit` command.

Determine the name of the integration test you want to modify, then run the following:

[,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc edit integrationtestscenario __<testname>__
----

Find the `spec` key and add `params` underneath it like this:

[,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
…
spec:
  params:
    - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
      value: github.com/enterprise-contract/config//slsa3
…
----

The `params` key should be at the same indent level as `application` and
`contexts` underneath the `spec` key.

Before saving the YAML file, to workaround a problem with the API versions
present in the cluster, you also need to also modify the API version to change
`v1beta1` to `v1alpha1` in the first line of the YAML file.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
----

Save the file to update the CR in the cluster.

NOTE: The config file specified in the above example is
link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/slsa3/policy.yaml[this
one]. There are some other
link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config[predefined configurations
available] in that same repo. You can of course substitute your own git repo
with your own customized policy file.

NOTE: The `//` syntax in the git url is used to separate the git repo location
and the subdirectory inside the git repo. EC will look for a `policy.yaml` or
`.ec/policy.yaml` file in the directory specified, or at the top level of the git
repo if no directory is specified. For details on this syntax consult the link:https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format[go-getter documentation].

== Using an EnterpriseContractPolicy Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR)

In the above example we set the `POLICY_CONFIGURATION` parameter in the
`IntegrationTestScenario` Custom Resource (CR) a git url. It's also possible to set it to the name
of a `EnterpriseContractPolicy` CR present in the cluster.

The following procedure shows how to create such a CR and reference it in the
`POLICY_CONFIGURATION` param.

Create a yaml file called `policy.yaml` with the following content:

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: EnterpriseContractPolicy
metadata:
  name: ec-policy
spec:
  description: An example custom EC policy
  publicKey: k8s://openshift-pipelines/public-key
  sources:
    - name: Release policies
      policy:
        - github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies//policy/lib
        - github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies//policy/release
      data:
        - oci::quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/data-acceptable-bundles:latest
        - github.com/release-engineering/rhtap-ec-policy//data
      config:
        include:
          - "*"
        exclude:
          - hermetic_build_task.*
----

This particular example will include every rule except for rules in the
`hermetic_build_task` package.

Ensure you have a current token and then create the CR in the cluster as follows:

[,shell]
----
$ oc create -f policy.yaml
----

The next step is to modify the IntegrationTestScenario CR as described above.

[,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc edit integrationtestscenario <testname>
----

The POLICY_CONFIGURATION value should be set to the name of the
EnterpriseContractPolicy CR that was just created.

[,yaml]
----
…
spec:
  params:
    - name: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
      value: ec-policy
…
----

Once again the API version workaround is needed, so modify the `apiVersion` value.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
----

Save the YAML file to update the IntegrationTestScenario CR with the new
policy configuration parameter value.

== Retriggering the integration test

There's currently no way to retrigger just the integration test, so to rerun
the Enterprise Contract pipeline a retrigger of the build pipeline is required.

This can be achieved by opening a new PR, typing `/retest` in an existing PR,
or by pushing a commit to `main` branch. An empty commit works fine, so you
could do this for example:

[,shell]
----
$ git commit -m "Trigger a Konflux rebuild" --allow-empty && git push origin main
----

For testing and debugging Enterprise Contract policies conveniently on your
workstation, you can use command line ec xref:cli.adoc[as
described here].
