= Using Cosign to verify Konflux build signatures & attestations

In this section we'll provide examples showing how to use cosign to verify
signatures and attestations for builds created by [Konflux
CI](https://github.com/konflux-ci), formerly [Red Hat App
Studio](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio).

For detailed information on Cosign refer to the
link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/[official documentation].

This document assumes cosign version 2.

== Introduction

Konflux uses link:https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/[Tekton Chains] to sign the
images created by Konflux build pipelines, and to create signed attestations
that include details about the Tekton pipeline run that created the image.

It's possible to verify these signatures and view the attestation directly
using cosign. This does require that you know the image ref of the container
image that was created, (i.e. the container repository and a tag or digest), of
the image that was created, and that you have access to that repository.

== Obtain image reference

When validating an image, from an application component for example, it is
recommended to always use an image reference includes a digest. The Konflux
build pipelines emit results that contain this information. They are called
`IMAGE_URL` and `IMAGE_DIGEST`. Combine the two with the `@` to create the
image reference with a digest. For example, if
`IMAGE_URL` is `quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload`, and `IMAGE_DIGEST`
is `sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d`,
the image reference that should be used during validatin is
`quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload@sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d`.

It is also possible to obtain the image reference from the Web UI.

== Obtain public key

Currently, Konflux uses a long-lived key for signing. This key can be retrieved
from the corresponding member cluster:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get -n openshift-pipelines secret public-key -o json | jq -r '.data."cosign.pub" | @base64d' > cosign.pub
----

== Validating the image

The first step in validating an image is verifying it has been signed with the
proper signature. This is to ensure the image was indeed built in a Konflux
build pipeline.

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
$ IMAGE='quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload@sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d'
$ cosign verify --key cosign.pub $IMAGE --insecure-ignore-tlog
WARNING: Skipping tlog verification is an insecure practice that lacks of transparency and auditability verification for the signature.

The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d"},"type":"cosign container image signature"},"optional":null}]
----

NOTE: At the moment, Konflux does not use a transparency log like Rekor. Starting
with version 2, cosign requires the explicit flag `--insecure-ignore-tlog` to
not use Rekor during the verification process.

Next, validate that the image contains the expected SLSA Provenance attestations.
Images built by the Konflux build pipeline will have two of them. One representing
the Tekton TaskRun in which the image was built, and one representing the Tekton
PipelineRun that contains the previously mentioned TaskRun. The attestation for
the PipelineRun is useful in understanding all the steps used when building the
image.

[.console-input]

  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
----

The output of the `cosign verify-attestation` command displays the attestations
themselves. The snippet above saves those attestations into a file, called
`slsa-provenance-attestations.json`.

At this point, a policy engine like OPA or conftest can be used to validate the
contents of the attestations.

At the moment, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) attachment is not signed.
However, it can be inspected via the `cosign download sbom` command. It is
important to note that this command offers no guarantee that the SBOM attachment
was produced as part of the Konflux build pipeline.

[source, bash]

$ IMAGE='quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload@sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d'
$ cosign download sbom $IMAGE > sbom.json
WARNING: Downloading SBOMs this way does not ensure its authenticity. If you want to ensure a tamper-proof SBOM, download it using 'cosign download attestation <image uri>' or verify its signature using 'cosign verify --key <key path> --attachment sbom <image uri>'.
Found SBOM of media type: application/vnd.cyclonedx+json
----

The snippet above saves the SBOM into a file named `sbom.json`. This file could
also be used as input to a policy engine. However, beware that since it is not
signed, it is susceptible to modifications outside the Konflux build pipeline.

== Using `cosign tree`

`cosign tree` is a useful command that lists all related entities for an image,
such as image signatures, image attestations, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
attachments.

For example:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
$ IMAGE='quay.io/konflux-ci/user-workload@sha256:de1c78cd8321ec999187dfc95ed5470b4a5b2bf5121a2482dba7b5965868253d'

Although `cosign tree` is not necessary for validation, it is a powerful
command to inspect the current state of an image.
