= Konflux CI, Conforma, and SLSA

.Overview
****

Konflux CI is a build and CI/CD system
that aims to meet or exceed https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels[SLSA Build L3 (v1.0)].
Conforma is an
https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts[artifact verifier] and
customizable policy checker designed to be easily integrated with Konflux's CI/CD
workflows.

A lot of the default policies created for Konflux and enforced by Conforma are closely
related to SLSA requirements, based on both the recent SLSA v1.0, and the older
SLSA v0.1 specification. In this documentation we'll describe in more detail
how Konflux and Conforma work together to provide a high standard of supply chain
security, informed and guided by the link:https://slsa.dev/[SLSA
specifications].

== SLSA Requirements

=== SLSA requirements verified explicitly by Conforma

Conforma comes with a set of policy rules designed for use with
Konflux. Using Conforma to verify that a build passes all the checks defined by the
policy provides a high level of confidence that the build was built securely
and can be trusted.

Many of the policy rules are linked to specific SLSA requirements, for example:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|SLSA reference|Conforma policy rule|Notes

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#scripted-build[Scripted build (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_script_used[Build task contains steps]
a| Konflux uses link:https://tekton.dev/[Tekton] so knowing that is enough to consider this requirement satisfied, however this specific
rule confirms it explicitly for each build. The rule asserts that the attestation includes details about the pipeline run that created the build,
that the specific task run that pushed the image is identifiable, and that information about each steps in that task run are present.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#build-service[Build service (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_found[SLSA Builder ID found]
a| This check aims to confirm the basic requirement from the v0.1 SLSA spec that the build ran on a build service. Once again, any build created
by Konflux is expected to meet this requirement, but the rule confirms this by verifying that that a builder is present in the SLSA attestation. The SLSA
Builder ID is also key part of the link:https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts] process
described in SLSA v1.0.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements#hermetic[Hermetic Builds (v0.1)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#hermetic_build_task__build_task_hermetic[Build task called with hermetic param set]
a| This rule verifies that the build task was called with a particular parameter specifying the build should be done hermeticly. This rule is specific
to Konflux's task definitions, since Conforma isn't able to explicitly confirm that the build was indeed hermetic. But, when combined with the strictest
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#trusted_task__trusted[trusted tasks rule], and a trustable source for the task definition, we can use the
rule to ensure that only builds performed hermeticly can be released.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_accepted[SLSA Builder ID is known and accepted]
a| The verification process described in the SLSA v1.0 spec includes a check to confirm the builder id matches what is
expected. This rule will fail if an unexpected builder id is found in the SLSA attestation. (For Konflux currently the builder id
is the default used by Tekton Chains, though this may change in the future.)

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats#f-upload-modified-package[Threat (G) - Upload modified package],
https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats#h-use-compromised-package[Threat (H) - Use compromised package] (v1.0)
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#builtin_image__signature_check[Image signature check passed]
a| Conforma uses a public key to validate the signature of the image using https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/[Cosign]. If the image
signature can't be verified for any reason, a failure will be reported. There are other ways to verify image signatures, e.g. by using `cosign` directly,
but Conforma will happily do it for you.

There is also experimental support in Conforma for validating signatures for images signed keylessly
using https://docs.sigstore.dev/fulcio/overview/[Sigstore Fulcio], though Konflux currently uses long-lived
signing keys to sign images and attestations.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#builtin_attestation__signature_check[Attestation signature check passed]
a| As well as verifying the image signature, Conforma also verifies the signature of the attestation, which is an important part of the artifact
verification process. For Konflux the same key is used to sign the attestation and the image itself. As mentioned above, there is experimental
support for verifying keylessly signed attestations.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_build_scripted_build__subject_build_task_matches[Provenance subject matches build task image result]
a| SLSA recommends an artifact verifier checks that the provenance statementâ€™s subject matches the digest of the artifact in question.
This is a good sanity check to confirm that the provenance being considered is for the expected image. Because Conforma uses Cosign under the hood, and
Cosign does this check as part of its signature verification, we get this confirmed automatically. The Conforma rule linked here performs an additional
confirmation by comparing the image reference produced by the build task and confirming that also matches the provenance subject.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#slsa_provenance_available__attestation_predicate_type_accepted[Expected attestation predicate type found]
a| SLSA suggests that the predicate type in the artifact's provenance should be `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`. This rule confirms that requirement,
and will fail if the predicate type is found to be any other value.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level[Verifying Artifacts (v1.0)]
a| xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#provenance_materials__git_clone_source_matches_provenance[Git clone source matches materials provenance]
a| This is a good sanity check related to artifact verification that isn't specifically mentioned in the SLSA guidelines. In Konflux build pipelines the
git clone task provides information about the git repo and the commit sha used. This rule confirms that the url and the commit sha from the git clone
task match what appears in the "materials" provenance.

=== SLSA requirements not explicitly verified by Conforma

There are numerous SLSA Build requirements that are met by Konflux CI, but not
explicitly verifiable with an Conforma policy rule. We won't go
into depth in this document, but for example:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|SLSA reference|Konflux response

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l2-hosted-build-platform[Build L2: Hosted build platform]
a| Due to its design, its architecture, and operational management, Konflux CI,
meets these requirements implicitly. And, as we've seen above, Conforma
can be used to verify the authenticity of the signed provenances.

a| https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3-hardened-builds[Build L3: Hardened builds]
a| For example, the Konflux's Tekton environment prevents different build pipelines from influencing each
other, and has secure access polices and management practices for signing secrets and other credentials.

In the future there may be some Konflux system level docs addressing this in more detail.
Linking to a general system overview of Konflux would also be useful here also I think.

== Notes and caveats

Because Conforma was designed initially for use with Konflux, and Konflux uses Tekton
CI/CD, many of the specific rules mentioned above are currently Tekton specific
in that they use details about the Tekton pipeline run, which are currently
made available in the SLSA attestation created by Tekton Chains.

This is not a limitation of Conforma itself, but rather just an attribute of the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc[policies created for Konflux] in their
current state. In the future we're aiming to extract the Tekton specific rules from
the general SLSA rules to make the rules more generally applicable. We expected
that policy rules for build systems not based on Tekton and Tekton Chains could
be created easily.

Note also that since Conforma can conveniently apply any policy defined in
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[OPA/Rego], it is
able to be used for a wide range of purposes, e.g. to verify certain tests were
run and passed, and to apply any business specific release policies. Browse the
rules defined in xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc[Policies] to see
what other rules have been defined for use by Konflux within Red Hat.

== Conclusion

Conforma can be used as a convenient and customizable SLSA artifact
verifier. It's doing that now within Konflux, and we think it's capable and
flexible enough to become a part of other build systems where supply chain security
is a priority.
