= Using the Conforma command line

== Installation

=== Downloading a binary

Visit link:https://github.com/conforma/cli/releases[the releases
page], scroll and expand "Assets". Find the appropriate binary for your system,
download it and copy it to somewhere in your path.

For example:

[,shell]
----
$ curl -sLO https://github.com/conforma/cli/releases/download/snapshot/ec_linux_amd64
$ chmod 755 ec_linux_amd64
$ sudo mv ec_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/ec
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

=== Running with docker or podman

If you have docker or podman installed you can also run ec like this:

[,shell]
----
$ docker pull quay.io/conforma/cli:snapshot
$ docker run quay.io/conforma/cli:snapshot
----

Substitute `podman` for `docker` in the above command if you're using podman.
For convenience you could create an alias. For example:

[,shell]
----
$ alias ec="docker run quay.io/conforma/cli:snapshot"
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

NOTE: There might be some extra work needed to mount files inside the
container, for example, if your public key is in a file, you would need to
mount it when running docker.

[,shell]
----
$ docker run -v ./key.pub:/tmp/key.pub:Z quay.io/conforma/cli:snapshot validate image ...
----

=== Compiling from source

To compile ec from source:

[,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:conforma/cli.git
$ cd cli
$ make build
$ sudo cp dist/ec_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/ec
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

== Validating an image

To run ec against a particular container image built by Konflux, we use the
`ec validate image` command. To see the command options you can use the
`--help` flag, e.g.:

[,shell]
----
$ ec validate image --help
----

When validating an image we need to provide three things:

- The image reference
- The public key for verifying signatures
- A policy configuration file which determines what policies are to be applied

For these examples I'm going to use a particular image with a known signing
key.

NOTE: Actually the public key can be provided via the policy configuration, but
for these examples we'll provide it separately using the `--public-key` flag.

For the sake of more readable examples, let's create some environment variables
and some files for the three pieces of information. For the `policy.yaml` we'll
download one of the predefined examples.

[,shell]
----
$ export IMAGE="quay.io/konflux-ci/ec-golden-image:latest"

$ echo '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEZP/0htjhVt2y0ohjgtIIgICOtQtA
naYJRuLprwIv6FDhZ5yFjYUEtsmoNcW7rx2KM6FOXGsCX3BNc7qhHELT+g==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----' > key.pub

$ wget -q https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/raw/main/slsa3/policy.yaml
----

Now we can run the ec like this:

[,shell]
----
$ ec validate image --image "$IMAGE" --public-key key.pub --policy policy.yaml --ignore-rekor --output yaml
----

NOTE:The image used in this example was signed and attested without using Rekor. This is why the `--ignore-rekor` flag is needed. You may not need this if you're using a different image

== Finding the public key

////
// This doesn't work for general users since they don't have the permissions to
// the openshift-pipelines namespace.

If you have access to the Konflux cluster, you can extract the public key like this:

[,shell]
----
kubectl get -n openshift-pipelines secret public-key -o jsonpath='{.data.cosign\.pub}' > cosign.pub
----
////

If you've run Conforma at least once using an integration test, as described in
xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting started...], the public key is visible in the
logs for the pipeline run.

NOTE: In the future there should be a better way to find the public key file
for the signing secret used by Tekton Chains in the Konflux build system.

You can now modify the `policy.yaml` file and re-run the `ec validate image`
command to try different policy configurations. See
xref:ecc:ROOT:index.adoc[the configuration docs] for more information on the
`policy.yaml` file, or take a look at the examples
link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config[here].

See also the how-to on xref:reproducing-a-konflux-conforma-report.adoc[reproducing the Conforma output from a Konflux
integration test].

== Validating arbitrary inputs

The `ec validate input` command line can be be used to validate arbitrary
structured data, specifically in JSON or YAML formats. The subcommand `ec
validate input` allows for checking the compliance of arbitrary number of files,
provided via `--file` parameter, to a set xref:ecc:ROOT:index.adoc[policy],
provided via `--policy` parameter.

For example let's consider a YAML file containing a set of sign-offs for a
release, and a policy mandating that a release must be signed-off by at least
two persons from each relevant department.

.data.yaml - the data for validation
[source,yaml]
----
---
image: registry.io/repository/image:tag  # the image that is signed-off on
quality_assurance:  # QA sign-offs
  - Elena Harper
  - Calvin Bean
product_development:  # product sign-offs
  - Lennon Bradford
  - Kate Levy
engineering:  # engineering sign-offs
  - Zayn Simmons
----

.policy.yaml - the policy configuration
[source,yaml]
----
description: ACME & co sign-off policy
sources:
  - name: default-sign-off
    policy:
      - "git::https://github.com/acme/policy.git//policy?ref=prod"
----

.signoff.rego - the policy rules in the `github.com/acme/policy.git` repository at `policy/signoff.rego`
[source,rego]
----
#
# METADATA
# title: ACME & co Sign-off policy
# description: >-
#   Mandates the compliance of sign-offs within ACME & co
#
package signoff

import rego.v1

# METADATA
# title: Each department needs to provide two sign-offs
# description: >-
#   Makes sure that each relevant department provided two sign-offs
# custom:
#   short_name: two_signoffs
#
deny contains result if {
	some department in {"quality_assurance", "product_development", "engineering"}
	count(input[department]) < 2
	result := sprintf("Missing required sign-offs from the %s department", [department])
}
----

With this, running the CLI shows that there is a policy violation, one sign-off
from the engineering department is missing:

[source,shell]
----
$ ec validate input --file data.yaml --policy policy.yaml --output yaml
ec-version: v0.4.2
effective-time: "2024-04-25T11:07:35.025505232Z"
filepaths:
- filepath: data.yaml
  success: false
  success-count: 1
  successes: null
  violations:
  - msg: Missing required sign-offs from the engineering department
  warnings: []
policy:
  description: ACME & co sign-off policy
  sources:
  - name: default-sign-off
    policy:
    - git::https://github.com/acme/policy.git//policy?ref=prod
success: false
Error: success criteria not met
----

=== Validating policy configuration

As a convention, the
xref:policy:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#policy_data[`policy_data`] collection
includes rules that check the conformance of xref:custom-data.adoc[rule data].
When customizing the rule data this can be used to validate that the data is
well formed.

For this a policy as in the following example can be used:

.policy.yaml - policy validating the rule data
[source,yaml]
----
description: Custom rule data validation
sources:
  - policy:
      - github.com/conforma/policy//policy/lib
      - github.com/conforma/policy//policy/release
    data:
      - /path/to/rule_data.yml
      - /path/to/required_tasks.yml
    config:
      include:
        - '@policy_data'
----

Given that the policy already includes all the data needed for the validation no
input needs to be provided on the `ec validate input` command, an empty input
can be provided for the `--file` parameter with: `--file='{}'`.
