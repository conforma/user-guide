= Using the Enterprise Contract command line

== Installation

=== Downloading a binary

Visit link:https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-cli/releases[the releases
page], scroll and expand "Assets". Find the appropriate binary for your system,
download it and copy it to somewhere in your path.

For example:

[,bash]
----
$ curl -sLO https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-cli/releases/download/snapshot/ec_linux_amd64
$ chmod 755 ec_linux_amd64
$ sudo mv ec_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/ec
$ which ec
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

=== Running with docker or podman

If you have docker or podman installed you can also run ec like this:

[,bash]
----
$ podman run quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-cli:snapshot
----

For convenience you could create an alias. For example:

[,bash]
----
$ alias ec="podman run quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-cli:snapshot"
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

NOTE: There might be some extra work needed to mount files, for example, if
your public key is in a file, you would need to mount it. In the examples below
I'm passing the content of the public key file rather than the file name to
avoid this.

[,bash]
----
podman run -v ./key.pub:/tmp/key.pub quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-cli:snapshot validate image ...
----

=== Compiling from source

To compile ec from source:

[,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:hacbs-contract/ec-cli.git
$ cd hacbs-contract
$ make build
$ sudo cp dist/ec_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/ec
$ which ec
$ ec version
$ ec --help
----

== Validating an image

To run ec against a particular container image built by Stonesoup, we use the
`ec validate image` command. To see the command options you can use the
`--help` flag, e.g.:

[,bash]
----
$ ec validate image --help
----

For these examples I'm going to use a particular image with a known signing
key.

When validating an image we need to provide three things:

- The image reference
- The public key for verifying signatures
- A policy configuration file which determines what policies are to be applied

NOTE: Actually the public key can be provided via the configuration, but for
these examples we'll provide it separately using the `--public-key` flag.

For the sake of more readable command lines in these examples, let's create a
some environment vars and a file for the three pieces of information:

[,bash]
----
$ export IMAGE_REF="quay.io/cuipinghuo/hermetic_build:0.3"

$ export PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEpXcIGCQmaP7qhEq/xfXT49BNBmTE
AWJvteQ7WiOp1VovrkOlqW64afWtf3qPz70ETXUhZ42lHvg1aKu24vKK/w==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"

$ echo '
sources:
  - policy:
      - "quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-release-policy:latest"
    data:
      - "quay.io/hacbs-contract/ec-policy-data:latest"
configuration:
  collections:
    - minimal
  include:
    - "*"
  exclude: []
' > policy.yml
----

Now we can run the ec like this:

[,bash]
----
$ ec validate image --output yaml --image "$IMAGE_REF" \
    --public-key "$PUBLIC_KEY" --policy "$(yq -ojson -I0 config.yml)" | yq
----

NOTE: The inline policy configuration needs to be json formatted, but I want to
use yaml for these examples, so that's why the `yq -ojson ...` is used above.
In future ec should support yaml directly, see
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HACBS-1898[HACBS-1898].

== Finding the public key

If you have access to the Stonesoup cluster, you can extract the public key like this:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get -n tekton-chains secret public-key -o jsonpath='{.data.cosign\.pub}' > cosign.pub
----

== Finding your image ref

Todo. Should be visible in a task result.
