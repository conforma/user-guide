= Getting started with Enterprise Contract & Konflux CI

== Creating an application

If you don't already have an application defined in Konflux, follow the
link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/getting-started/get-started/[getting
started guide here]. Once that's done you should have an application with at least one component.

To get the most out of Enterprise Contract it's recommended that you also upgrade to a custom build pipeline
link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline/[as
described here].

== Creating an integration test

To run the Enterprise Contract pipeline automatically after each build, an integration test is
used. One should be automatically created when a new application is created. The process of
recreating it manually is
link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/proc_managing-compliance-with-the-enterprise-contract/[described here].

NOTE: You can view the definitions of the
link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml[Enterprise Contract pipeline],
and the link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli/blob/main/tasks/verify-enterprise-contract/0.1/verify-enterprise-contract.yaml[Enterprise
Contract task].

NOTE: If you prefer to pin the pipeline bundle to a particular version, instead of using the `devel` tag, use one of the pinned tags
link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract?tab=tags[visible here].
Note that the name of the tag matches a commit sha in the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions[build-definitions repo].
You could also use a container image digest to pin to more securely.

NOTE: In the future it will be possible to use a git resolver to specify the
pipeline definition in its git repo instead of as a Tekton bundle image
reference. It's expected this will become the preferred way to specify the
integration test pipeline.

== Viewing Enterprise Contract results

With the Enterprise Contract integration test created, each successful build
pipeline run will trigger an integration test pipeline run. You can find the
integration test pipeline runs by clicking the integration test under the
"Integration Tests" tab.

The Enterprise Contract results can be seen under the "Security" tab, for example
this shows a passing Enterprise Contract test:

The raw output from the Enterprise Contract task is YAML formatted and can be
seen in the pipeline run logs, particularly under the "STEP-REPORT" heading:
